## Automated Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm run test
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
npm run test:integration
```

### E2E Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

## Test Users

After running `npx tsx scripts/seed-database.ts`:

- **Admin:** admin@royalgems.com / Admin123!@#
- **Customer:** customer@test.com / Customer123!@#

## Common Issues

### Issue: Supabase connection fails
**Solution:** Check .env.local has correct SUPABASE_URL and keys

### Issue: Auth returns 401
**Solution:** Verify access token is valid and not expired

### Issue: RLS blocks queries
**Solution:** Check user role and policy configuration

### Issue: TypeScript errors in tests
**Solution:** Update tsconfig.json to include test files

## Next Steps

After completing all tests:
1. âœ… Mark Step 7 complete
2. ðŸš€ Move to Step 8: Deployment
3. ðŸ“Š Monitor production metrics
4. ðŸ”„ Set up CI/CD pipeline
